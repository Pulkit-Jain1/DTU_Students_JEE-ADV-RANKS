        <p class="no-padding-bottom">Important Directions to Use:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            When searching for a student's rank by name, please enter at least 3
            initial characters of the student's name. This will provide you with
            the ranks of all students whose names begin with those letters (Both
            Name and Roll No. are NOT case-sensetive).
          </li>
          <li>
            Valid Format of Roll Numbers are: 2k22/XX/01, 2k22/XX/11,
            2k22/XX/111, 23/XX/001, 23/XX/011, 23/XX/111
          </li>
          <li>
            For 2023 Batch: Data of Spot Round Students is not available and
            roll numbers are from before both branch upgradations done at DTU
            level
          </li>
          <li>
            For 2022 batch, second-year roll numbers are utilized. Those who did
            not have mappings from old roll numbers to new roll numbers are not
            included.
          </li>
          <li>
            "Not Eligible" under the CRL column means that the student either
            has not qualified in the mains by clearing their category cutoff, or
            they have not registered for JEE Adv.
          </li>
          <li>
            "Not Qualified" under the CRL column means that the student either
            has not cleared the cutoff for the JEE(Adv) exam to obtain a valid
            CRL/category rank, or they have registered for JEE Adv. but were
            absent during the exam.
          </li>
          <li>
            Only search by roll number can reveal the category of a student if
            they have obtained a valid category rank. In such cases, the heading
            'Category Rank' will automatically change to reflect the category to
            which the student belongs if they have obtained a rank in that
            category.
          </li>
          <li>
            This tool can only determine the category rank and category of a
            student if they belong to categories such as EWS, OBC, SC, or ST.
            Other categories, such as PWD, are not supported by this tool.

            This tool does NOT utilize any private or confidential data. All
            data utilized by it is PUBLICALY available. You can verify the

            All code for data extraction and the website is open-source, so I
            expect and hope that skilled programmers will create better projects
            by writing improved code, adding more functionalities, using data in
            more creative ways and creating better websites. Additionally, I
            anticipate that someone will extend this for the 2021 batch and
            upcoming 2024 batch. After all, this is the essence of open source,
            isn't it?

            Here are some interesting statistics from this data for the 2022
            batch: Out of 2459 students, 1702 were eligible or registered for
            the advanced exam. Among them, 426 students cleared the exam to
            obtain a valid CRL, 84 of them achieved a rank of less than 10,000.
          </li>
          <li>
            Similarly, for the 2023 batch: Out of 2493 students, 1822 were
            eligible or registered for the advanced exam. Among them, 418
            students cleared the exam to obtain a valid CRL, with 78 of them
            achieving a rank of less than 10,000.
